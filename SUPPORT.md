## How to file issues and get help

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, file your bug or
feature request as a new Issue.

Since I maintain Pyrefact and this extension on my own, for free and in my spare time, there are limits to how quickly I can solve problems that arise.
But I am committed to doing my best to keep both projects working well.

For help and questions about using this project, please use the GitHub Discussions.
